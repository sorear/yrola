= Yrola versus MonetDB

Yrola grows out of experience implementing a clustered multitenant analytics system with Monet.

== Requirements

|===
|Name|Category|In MonetDB?|Prio{empty}footnote:[4=Repeated crises to not have, 3=Scary to not have, 2=Strong goal, 1=Wishlist]|Description

|Fast commit
|Perf/Latency
|Yes
|2
|Write transactions must be a single append and fsync to a WAL.

|Read availability
|Perf/Latency
|Yes
|2
|Read and write transactions must not block each other.  (But we'll accept it for short I/O ops on separate tables).

|Read availability 2
|Perf/Latency
|No
|3
|Lengthy "checkpoint" type operations must not block reads or writes.  In MonetDB, checkpoints are done with the store lock held and only if store_nr_active=0.

|Write amplification
|Perf/Throughput
|No
|4
|Inclusive of all future checkpoints, inserting or updating a row must cause Ã•(1) physical writes.  MonetDB fails this, most writes require table rebuilds (which happen with the store lock held, grr).

|Physical backups
|Safety
|No
|3
|It should be possible to copy all data files out of a live database, possibly while holding a lock but without a server restart.

|Query termination
|Safety
|No
|3
|KILL QUERY must work reliably.

|Resource limits
|Safety
|No
|3
|A misbehaving query MUST NOT kill the server, the database must monitor memory and disk resources to avoid crises (issuing internal KILL QUERY).

|Better durability 1
|Safety
|No
|4
|Observed MonetDB failure mode: spontaneous row duplication

|Corruption robustness
|Safety
|No
|4
|If the server sees bad data on disk, it should disable access to the table in question but stay up pending administrator intervention.

|Data types
|Functionality
|No
|2
|MonetDB types are quite limited because of the macro-based implementation strategy.
Yrola baselines a LLVM-based runtime code generation to push the combinatorial explosion to runtime where it can be managed lazily.
