* Query optimzation

** Operation fusion.

** Distinguish operations based on concurrency behavior: "butterfly" versus "passthrough".
Two butterflies generally cannot be merged.
Null butterflies may be desired for rebalancing in some cases.

** Try to use fusion to eliminate temporaries: significantly enhances log-structure mode and recycling.

* Clustering

** It's just another layer of butterflies.
Cache aware streaming design gives us an easy route to NUMA and distribution.

** Special "non-atomic delayable batch UPSERT" transaction allows for updating a group of replicas efficiently.
Group commit for Paxos, or perhaps reconciliation.
